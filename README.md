Implementation and illustration of the Graham scan algorithm. (Inspired by an entrance exam for ENS)

Enter a list tab of the form [[x coordinates], [y coordinates]]. The program plots the convex hull of this set of points using Graham scan.

Note: It is a known fact that, given A_1,...,A_n n points randomly chosen on the unit circle, the probability of the event "the center O of the circle lies within the convex hull of A_1,..A_n" has probability
      1 - n/(2^{n-1}). You may use my probability simulator toolkit to illustrate this result using various laws to pick A_1,...,A_n.
